        <article>
          <p class="blog-text">
            In the summer of 2021, the global shipping crisis had reached the
            point at which it was almost completely unviable to import furniture
            frames from the far east. Since this was our main method of
            acquiring complicated frames, we faced a bit of a problem, but also
            an unlikely opportunity. <br /><br />
            For the first time in many decades, there was an opportunity to
            bring some manufacturing back to the UK, as the financial element
            suddenly made sense in the face of the enormous shipping costs. It
            was this realisation (coupled with a vision and optimism regarding
            what this could bring to the business) that led to the beginning of
            our search for a suitable machine. <br /><br />
            Many suitors presented themselves, claiming to be the machine
            manufacturers who could solve our problems, but most came up short -
            in one way or another. It was only after having heard out the big
            players in the game that a previously unknown to us company, Bacci,
            entered the fray. Their demonstrations were impressive, and the
            machine had one thing the others didn’t: a sixth axis. <br /><br />
            Once the paperwork was finished, we began the long wait for
            delivery. The day finally arrived in mid-July 2022. Three weeks of
            installation and training ensued and then we were left alone; the
            theory was there, but the specifics and knowledge needed for
            practicality still eluded us. <br /><br />
            As is apt to happen, other projects then took the front seat. We
            were, however, provided some relief from our "frame-woes" by a deal
            struck with our big customer to purchase an enormous number at once.
            One thing after another meant that, by the end of 2022, we had still
            only cut theory-proving pieces on the machine. <br /><br />
            Now, at the beginning of 2023, the 6-axis project is back on, and we
            are approaching it with a renewed vigour. I hope in the posts below
            to be able to bring you along on this journey, as it happens, to
            give a flavour of the difficulties we face in bringing our vision to
            fruition.

          <p class="blog-text">
            Last week I finished an advanced course with our CAM software
            provider and with this training fresh in my mind, I feel a renewed
            sense of enthusiasm. The software in question is called Alphacam,
            and it’s our sole port of call for the <i>toolpath</i> generation
            that we need to create the machine programs. The numeric code (NC)
            generated from this application is then fed into the proprietary
            software that was shipped with the product – Pitagora. I can use
            that to do the final checks on my program and turn it into machine
            code that that can be run. <br />
            <br />
            All very well in principle, but - unfortunately - not so straight
            forward in practice. But okay, let’s try to build on the things I
            learnt last week – at least it's somewhere to start. <br />
            <br />
            The training was specifically focused on utilising the advanced
            5-axis tools that are available within Alphacam: these don’t ship as
            standard with the package and we’ve had to shell out quite a bit
            extra to acquire them, but it will 100% be worth it for what we’re
            trying to achieve. However, I just want to start off small - prove
            some concepts first… I’m going to need something to cut. <br />
            <br />
            So, my first port of call is our CAD software, SolidWorks, where I
            can quickly design something made specifically for the purpose of
            testing. I whip up a funny little model that has specific features I
            can target with different machining methods within Alphacam – I
            creatively call it: “AlphaTestPiece”.

            It’s not much to look at, but I reckon that this will be a great
            project to get me off the ground – it has a bit of everything. So, I
            have my subject and now it’s time to start trying to bring it to
            life. I switch over to Alphacam and begin attempting to create some
            tool paths. It’s worth noting that I designed AlphaTestPiece with
            our 3-axis CNC in mind – a machine we understand very well. I can
            layer up bits of CNC-machined plywood and get a “blank” of a known
            starting shape, which is essential and easy to do with our existing
            knowledge.

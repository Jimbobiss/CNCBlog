          <p class="blog-text">
            In the summer of 2021, the global shipping crisis had reached the
            point at which it was almost completely unviable to import furniture
            frames from the far east. Since this was our main method of
            acquiring complicated frames, we faced a bit of a problem, but also
            an unlikely opportunity. <br><br>  For the first time in many decades, there
            was an opportunity to bring some manufacturing back to the UK, as
            the financial element suddenly made sense in the face of the
            enormous shipping costs. It was this realisation (coupled with a
            vision and optimism regarding what this could bring to the
            business) that led to the beginning of our search for a suitable
            machine. <br><br> Many suitors presented themselves, claiming to be the machine
            manufacturers who could solve our problems, but most came up short -
            in one way or another. It was only after having heard out the big
            players in the game that a previously unknown to us company, Bacci,
            entered the fray. Their demonstrations were impressive, and the
            machine had one thing the others didnâ€™t: a sixth axis. <br><br> Once the
            paperwork was finished, we began the long wait for delivery. The day
            finally arrived in mid-July 2022. Three weeks of installation and
            training ensued and then we were left alone; the theory was there,
            but the specifics and knowledge needed for practicality still 
            eluded us. <br><br> As is apt to happen, other projects then took the front seat. We were, however, provided
            some relief from our "frame-woes" by a deal struck with our big
            customer to purchase an enormous number at once. One thing after
            another meant that, by the end of 2022, we had still only cut
            theory-proving pieces on the machine. <br><br> Now, at the beginning of 2023, the 6-axis
            project is back on, and we are approaching it with a renewed vigour.
            I hope in the posts below to be able to bring you along on this journey, as it
            happens, to give a flavour of the difficulties we face in bringing
            our vision to fruition.

        <article>
          <p class="blog-text">
            In the summer of 2021, the global shipping crisis had reached a
            point at which it was almost completely unviable to import furniture
            frames from the far east. Since this was our main method of
            acquiring complicated frames, we faced a bit of a problem, but also
            an unlikely opportunity. <br /><br />
            For the first time in many decades, there was an opportunity to
            bring some manufacturing back to the UK, as the financial element
            suddenly made sense in the face of the enormous shipping costs. It
            was this realisation (coupled with a vision and optimism regarding
            what this could bring to the business) that led to the beginning of
            our search for a suitable machine. <br /><br />
            Many suitors presented themselves, claiming to be the machine
            manufacturers who could solve our problems, but most came up short -
            in one way or another. It was only after having heard out the big
            players in the game that a previously unknown to us company, Bacci,
            entered the fray. Their demonstrations were impressive, and the
            machine had one thing the others didn’t: a sixth axis. <br /><br />
            Once the paperwork was finished, we began the long wait for
            delivery. The day finally arrived in mid-July 2022. Three weeks of
            installation and training ensued and then we were left alone; the
            theory was there, but the specifics and knowledge needed for
            practicality still eluded us. <br /><br />
            As is apt to happen, other projects then took the front seat. We
            were, however, provided some relief from our "frame-woes" by a deal
            struck with our big customer to purchase an enormous number at once.
            One thing after another meant that, by the end of 2022, we had still
            only cut theory-proving pieces on the machine. <br /><br />
            Now, at the beginning of 2023, the 6-axis project is back on, and we
            are approaching it with a renewed vigour. I hope in the posts below
            to be able to bring you along on this journey, as it happens, to
            give a flavour of the difficulties we face in bringing our vision to
            fruition.

          <p class="blog-text">
            Last week I finished an advanced course with our CAM software
            provider and with this training fresh in my mind, I feel a renewed
            sense of enthusiasm. The software in question is called Alphacam,
            and it’s our sole port of call for the <i>toolpath</i> generation
            that we need to create the machine programs. The numeric code (NC)
            generated from this application is then fed into the proprietary
            software that was shipped with the product – Pitagora. I can use
            that to do the final checks on my program and turn it into machine
            code that that can be run. <br />
            <br />
            All very well in principle, but - unfortunately - not so straight
            forward in practice. So, let’s try to build on the things I learnt
            last week – at least it's somewhere to start. <br />
            <br />
            The training was specifically focused on utilising the advanced
            5-axis tools that are available within Alphacam: these don’t ship as
            standard with the package and we’ve had to shell out quite a bit
            extra to acquire them, but it will 100% be worth it for what we’re
            trying to achieve. However, I just want to start off small - prove
            some concepts first… I’m going to need something to cut. <br />
            <br />
            So, my first port of call is our CAD software, SolidWorks, where I
            can quickly design something made specifically for the purpose of
            testing. I whip up a funny little model that has specific features I
            can target with different machining methods within Alphacam – I
            creatively call it: “AlphaTestPiece”.

            It’s not much to look at, but I reckon that this will be a great
            project to get me off the ground – it has a bit of everything. So, I
            have my subject and now it’s time to start trying to bring it to
            life. I switch over to Alphacam and begin attempting to create some
            tool paths (It’s worth noting that I designed AlphaTestPiece with
            our 3-axis CNC in mind – a machine we understand very well. I can
            layer up bits of CNC-machined plywood and get a “blank” of a known
            starting shape, which is essential and easy to do with our existing
            knowledge).

            Alphacam turns out not to be as compliant as I was hoping it to be,
            and after 2 or 3 hours of frustration, I have only managed to create
            two finishing toolpaths and one bodged-together roughing toolpath. I
            decide that it’s not worth banging my head against the wall anymore
            today and settle for what I’ve put together so far. Now it’s time to
            export the Alphacam NC and import it into Pitagora – the proprietary
            software from the machine makers, Bacci.

          <p class="blog-text">
            It's at this point, within Pitagora, that I now realise there’s
            something strange going on with the way Alphacam is generating
            rapids (rapid movements of the machine outside of cutting
            movements). In fact, it seems to be ploughing the tool and head of
            the machine through the workpiece at the beginning of quite a few of
            the operations. This is definitely not what I want. Unfortunately,
            this means I’m going to have to manually edit the G-code to change
            these errant manoeuvres (until I can get someone from Alphacam to
            look into the issue). I isolate the problematic moves by running
            simulations, line-by-line, and then manually edit the coordinates to
            prevent the collisions from occurring. This takes quite a while and
            is very fiddly but, by the end of it, I have a program that doesn’t
            collide with anything and <i>should</i> actually cut some wood!
            <br /><br />
            Next, I run a full program collision check in Pitagora - just to
            confirm that nothing is wrong; the software is extremely good for
            this purpose. I now remember that to generate the machine code, I
            have to compile the program on the PC attached to the machine itself
            – not sure why, but that’s how it is - so off I go. Now I make a
            mistake that teaches me a valuable lesson: don't run a collision
            check on the machine PC. The reason this was a bad idea is that,
            strangely, our machine PC is only running an Intel i3 processor, so
            the collision checking execution is painfully slow. In the future
            I'll run all collision checks on <i>my</i> PC to take advantage of
            the far superior hardware. <br /><br />
            Finally, I have the machine-runnable code: this is the critical
            moment. I remember our machine training from all those months ago
            and how to load a program - it’s actually surprisingly easy although
            sometimes a bit quirky. Nonetheless, it’s nothing I can’t get around
            and it works as expected on this occasion. I click the big green
            <span class="start-btn">START</span> button, which primes the
            program. I’m going to run this very slowly in clean air to begin
            with - even though I’ve been assured many times that there won’t be
            any collisions, seeing is believing when you're playing with your
            company’s biggest single machine investment. <br /><br />
            The spindle whizzes up to 24,000 RPM, emitting a gentle whirring
            sound, and I slowly turn the speed controller dial clockwise. The
            machine begins to move. The next few minutes are spent with my
            finger hovering over the <span class="stop-btn">STOP</span> button,
            as I watch happen exactly what Pitagora said would happen.
            Eventually the table that would carry our testing piece returns from
            the inner enclosure and the spindle decelerates to a stop:
            everything is in one piece. I have successfully run a program
            utilizing more than 3 axes! This makes me feel pretty good, but I
            still don’t have my shaped piece of wood. <br /><br />
            Earlier in the day, we had nested, cut and assembled some of the
            blanks required to machine our AlphaTestPiece and now their time has
            come. I set up the machine’s vacuum system and turn on the pump,
            then I take one of our plywood blanks and correctly position it onto
            the machine table. There’s a foot pedal below the table which I step
            on to activate the vacuum, suctioning the blank down and holding it
            in place. It’s ready to go! I turn the speed dial up and carefully
            begin the program. Everything plays out exactly as intended and by
            the end of it, I have a product!

          </figure>

          <p class="blog-text">
            As you can see, it doesn’t have all of the features that I had
            modelled originally, but the main shape of the body is there and it
            has helped prove countless theories. This is the physical
            representation of a big step forward in understanding this machine
            and how to use CNC beyond 3 axes. I am, frankly, really pleased and
            go to show off my new, vaguely barn-like, piece of wood to anyone
            left in the factory at this time of night. At the start of the day
            our portfolio of practical experience was bare, but now I have added
            the first and one of the most important entries.<br /><br />
            It’s late and time for me to leave, but my optimism is flying high
            and I’m looking forward to conquering the next step in the project:
            adding the remaining features to the finished piece.""
            <br /><br />
            For now, I’m going to bed.
